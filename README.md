# General Information
- This is a simple GUI program that helps to download a YouTube video by a given URL.
- Tkinter is used for GUI design and pytube is used for downloading the YouTube. 
- I created this program to practice and test my skill in GUI programming as I just started learning Tkinter.
> I'm only doing this project for fun, but feel free to provide any suggestions to improve.

# Setup
1. Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required Python libraries.
```bash
python -m pip install pytube
```
# Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Run yt_downloader.py on an IDE or using command prompt by directing to the folder path and type:
  ``` bash
  python yt_downloader.py
  ```

# Reflections
- I've always wanted to get into GUI development and I think I'm off to a pretty good start.
- I still have a lots of inline programs that I wish to develop it as an GUI application.
- Overall, I think this first project has provided me with a good amount of experience to let me expand further.
